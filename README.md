Objective: To develop a deep learning model for classifying text data using TensorFlow.
Technologies Used:
TensorFlow
Python (NumPy, Pandas)
Text Pre-processing (Tokenization, Vectorization)
Neural Network Architectures
Key Features:
Implemented text pre-processing techniques for noise reduction and normalization.
Built a neural network model for text classification using TensorFlow.
Trained the model on labeled datasets, optimizing performance metrics such as accuracy and loss.
Fine-tuned hyperparameters to enhance the model's prediction performance.
Outcome:
Achieved an accuracy rate of X% (you can fill in the exact figure if applicable).
Demonstrated model reliability through precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
